# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Obstacle Tower! We are
incredibly excited to see how members of our community will use and extend the
environment for their own research. To facilitate your contributions, we've outlined a brief set
of guidelines to ensure that your extensions can be easily integrated.

## Communication

First, please read through our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), as we
expect all our contributors to follow it.

Second, before starting on a project that you intend to contribute to Obstacle Tower (whether changes to the task itself, or improvements to code or documentation), we
**strongly** recommend posting on our
[Issues page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-project/issues)
and briefly outlining the changes you plan to make. This will enable us to
provide some context that may be helpful for you. This could range from advice
and feedback on how to optimally perform your changes or reasons for not doing
it.

Lastly, if you're looking for input on what to contribute, feel free to
reach out to us directly at ml-agents@unity3d.com.

## Git Branches

We follow the
[Gitflow Workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
Consequently, the `master` branch corresponds to the latest release of
the project, while the `develop` branch corresponds to the most recent, stable,
version of the project.

Thus, when adding to the project, **please branch off `develop`**
and make sure that your Pull Request (PR) contains the following:

* Detailed description of the changes performed
* Corresponding changes to documentation and unit tests
* Summary of the tests performed to validate your changes
* Issue numbers that the PR resolves (if any)

## Environment Changes

While we will likely directly accept changes which improve documentation and code quality, fig bugs, or improve performance, we have stricter criteria for additions to the environment itself. These will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for inclusion into the project. Please open an issue to discuss these with us.

## Contributor License Agreements

When you open a pull request, you will be asked to acknolwedge our Contributor License Agreement. We allow both individual contributions and contributions made on behalf of companies. We use an open source tool called CLA assistant. If you have any questions on our CLA, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-project/issues) or email us at ml-agents@unity3d.com.
